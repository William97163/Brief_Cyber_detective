I really appreciate the retro yet current vibe. The song works really well with the choir, I'd even say the choir is making the song work. I'm still not a fan of Achille's little ""random noises"" but the song works really well.

Great to see him back again and this is musically similar to his great entry ""Rolls Royce"" from 2019. Nice use of the choir but the song is weak and depends on repetition and I'm a tad disappointed. 6/10 https://t.co/7dH9H0jKzA"|'Sanremo2022'|1|0|2

I really appreciate the retro yet current vibe. The song works really well with the choir, I'd even say the choir is making the song work. I'm still not a fan of Achille's little ""random noises"" but the song works really well.

I really appreciate the retro yet current vibe. The song works really well with the choir, I'd even say the choir is making the song work. I'm still not a fan of Achille's little ""random noises"" but the song works really well.

Great to see him back again and this is musically similar to his great entry ""Rolls Royce"" from 2019. Nice use of the choir but the song is weak and depends on repetition and I'm a tad disappointed. 6/10 https://t.co/7dH9H0jKzA"|'Sanremo2022'|1|0|2

Song 1 Achille Lauro &amp; Harlem Gospel Choir -""Domenica"".
Great to see him back again and this is musically similar to his great entry ""Rolls Royce"" from 2019. Nice use of the choir but the song is weak and depends on repetition and I'm a tad disappointed. 6/10 https://t.co/7dH9H0jKzA"|'Sanremo2022'|1|0|2

Achille is on stage, barefoot and shirtless, so the tats are on full display. The Harlem Gospel Choir is a fun addition and get the spotlight in the final part of the song.

Great to see him back again and this is musically similar to his great entry ""Rolls Royce"" from 2019. Nice use of the choir but the song is weak and depends on repetition and I'm a tad disappointed. 6/10 https://t.co/7dH9H0jKzA"|'Sanremo2022'|1|0|2
